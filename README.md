# CPU Utilization Prediction

This project aims to predict CPU utilization using historical data. The goal is to create a model that can forecast CPU usage based on various factors like time of day, number of active processes, and memory usage.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model development.
- **src/**: Source code for data processing, modeling, and API deployment.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for the project.
- **Dockerfile**: Configuration for containerizing the application.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpu-utilization-prediction.git
